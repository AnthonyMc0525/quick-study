# Quick Study

## What is this repo?

This repo is going to be one used for me to plan and track a learning
experiment. I will be trying to learn 6 programming languages and one framework
in
a quick amount of time.

Each language will be a sprint of about 2 weeks. The first week will be strictly
learning as much as I can about the lanuage and what kind of things it is
commonly used for. The second week will be me trying to build something with it
and applying what I learned in the first week.


## Languages that will be studied

- Java
- C#
- Clojure
- Rust
- Perl
- LISP

## Framwork that will be studied

- Wordpress


The order in which I will be going through them is not in the order listed
above. This will be the order in which I will be studying:

- Wordpress
- Java
- LISP
- Perl
- Closure

- Rust
